            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere are so many things of great importance to be said in very little time this day, that I conceive it will not be unacceptable to your Lordships, if setting by all Rhetoricall affectations, I only in plaine country language humbly pray your favour to include many excuses, necessary for my manifold infirmities, in this one word; I am commanded by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the Commons House, to present unto your Lordships their most affectionate thanks, for your ready condescending to this conference; which Act of confidence in your great wisdome, and approved Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, for the service of His Majestie, and the welfare of this Realme, they desire upon this oceasion: The House of Commons by a totall, and universall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of complaints, from all the Sea bordering Ports of this Kingdome, did find a great and grievous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and stop of trade and traffick, the base Pyrats of Salley, ignominiously infesting our coasts, taking our ships, and goods, and leading away the subjects of this kingdome into barbarous Captivity, while to our shame and hinderance of Commerce, our enemies did as it were besiege our Ports and block up our best Rivers months, our Friends over-flight pretences made Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargoes of our Merchants goods, and every nation on the least occasion was ready to continue, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:196935:2"/>slight us; So great was the apparent diminutions of the ancient honour of this Crown, and high reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this our Nation, wherewith the Commons were more troubled, calling to remembrance, how formerly in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Holy</hi>-land, and every where by Sea &amp; Land the vallour of this Kingdom had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter valued, &amp; even in latter times, within remembrance, when we had no alliance with <hi>Denmarke,</hi> or in <hi>Germany,</hi> nor friends in <hi>Italy, Scotland,</hi> (to say no more) Unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited; <hi>Ireland</hi> not setled in Peace, and much lesse se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity at home, when <hi>Spaine</hi> as ambitious as it is under a King they call their wisest, the house of <hi>Austria</hi> as great and potent, and strengthened with a malicious league in <hi>France,</hi> of persons ill-affected, when the Low-countries had no being, yet by constant councells, and old English wayes, even then that Spanish pride was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, the greatnesse of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> now made so formidable to us, was well resisted, and to the united Provinces of the Low-countries, such a beginning, growth and strength was given, as gave us honour over all the Christian world.</p>
            <p>The Commons therefore wondring at the Evills they suffered, and debating of the causes of them, found that they were many, drawn like lines to one circumference of the decay of the Trade, honour, and reputation of this Kingdom; which all as in one Center, met in one great man, the cause of all, whom I am here to name, <hi>The Duke of Buckingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Sir <hi>D. Digs</hi> paused, as wondring to see the Duke present, yet he took the Roll, &amp; read the Preamble here following to the charges, with the Dukes long Title.</p>
            <p>For the speedy redresse of the great Evills and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and of the causes of these Evills and Mischiefs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:196935:3"/>which this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> now grievously suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and of late yeers hath suffered, and to the honour and safety of our Soveraign Lord the King, &amp; of his crown and dignity, to the welfare of his people the Commons of this present Parliament, by authority of our said So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King assembled, Do by this their Bill shew and declare, against <hi>George,</hi> Duke, Marquesse and Earl of Buckingham, Earl of Coventry, Viscount <hi>Villers,</hi> Baron of Whaddon, great Admirall of the Kingdoms of England &amp; Ireland, and of the principality of Wales, and of the Dominion and Ilands of the same, and of the Town of Calice, and of the Marches of the same, and of Normandy, Gascoin, Guyene, Generall Governour of the Seas and Ships of the said Kingdom, Lievtenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Admirall Captain generall and governour of his Majesties Royall Fleet and Army, lately set forth, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the horse of our Soveraigne Lord the King, Lord Warden, Chancellor and admirall of the Cinque ports, and of the members thereof, Constable of Dover-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Windsor, Gentleman of his Majesties Bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one of his Majesties most honourable privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in his Realms both of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> Lord Leivtenant of the counties of Middlesex &amp; Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, and Knight of the most honourable order of the Garter, the misdemeanors, misprisions, offences, crimes, and other matters comprised in the Articles hereafter following, and him the said Duke do accuse and impeach of the said misdemeanors, misprisions, offences and crimes.</p>
            <p>My Lords; The lofty title of this mighty man me thinks doth raise my spirits to speake with a <hi>Paulo maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra canamus,</hi> and let it not displease your Lordships if for our foundation, I compare the beautifull structture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:196935:3"/>and fair composition of this monarchy wherein we live, to the great work of God, the world it self, in which the sollid body of incorporate Earth and Seas (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave) in regard of our husbandry, manifactures and commerce by Land and Seas may well resemble us the Commons, and as it is incompassed with Air and Fire and Sphears celestiall of Planets, and a firmament of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed starres, all which receive their heat, and life, &amp; light, from one great glorious sun, even like the King, our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne; so that firmament of fixed stars, I take to be your Lordships; those planets the great officers of the Kingdome, that pure element of fire, the most religious, zealous, pious Clergy, and the reverend Judges, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and Ministers of Law and Justice; the Air, wherein we breath all, who truly labour for them all, and though they be the footstoole and the lowest, yet may well be said, to be the fettled Center of the state.</p>
            <p>Now (my good Lords) if that glorious Sun by his powerfull beames of grace and favour shall draw from the bowels of this earth an exhalation that shal take fire and burne and shine out like a starre; it need not be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at, if the poore commons gaze and wonder at the Commet, and when they feele the effects, impute all to the corruptible matter of it; But if such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teor appear like that in the last age in the Chair of Cassiopeia amongst the fixed starres them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, where Aristotle and the old Philosophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved there is no place for such corruptions; then as the learned Mathematitians were troubled to observe, the irregular motions, the prodigious magnitude, the ominous prognosticks of the Meteor, so the commons when they see a blasing starre, in course so exorbitant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:196935:4"/>in the affaires of the Common-wealth, cannot but looke up upon it, and for want of prospectives, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the neerer examinations thereof to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, who may behold it at a better distance, such a prodigious commet the Commons apprehend the Duke of Buckingham to be, against whom, and his irregular wayes, there are by learned Gentlemen, legall Articles of charge to be delivered to your Lordships, which I am generally first commanded to lay open.</p>
            <p>First, the Officers of this Kingdome, which are the eyes, the eares, and the hands of this common-wealth, these have been ingrossed, bought and sold, and many of the greatest of them holden in the Dukes own hands, which severally in former times gave sufficient content to the greatest Favourites, and were worke enough for the wisest councellors; by meanes whereof what strange abuses, what infinite neglects have followed, the Seas have been ungarded, Trade disturbed, Marchants op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, their Ships, and even one of the Royall Ships by cunning practise delivered over into forraign hands, and contrary to our good Kings intention, imployed to the prejuduce, almost to the Ruine of friends of our owne Religion.</p>
            <p>Next, Titles and degrees of honour, those most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewels of the crown, a treasure inestimable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your noble ancestors (my Lords) were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for eminent &amp; Publique services in the cōmon-wealth at home, and for brave exployts abroad: when covered all with dust and bloud, they sweat in service for the honour of this Crown, what backwayes, and what by-wayes have been found out by this Duke, is too well known unto your honours; whereas anciently it was the honour of England, as amongst the Romans,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:196935:4"/>the way to the Temple of honour, was through the Temple of vertue; But I am commanded to presse this no farther, then to let your Lordships know, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may perhaps be given of some one Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to purchase honour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as divers of the Dukes poore kindred have been raised to great honours, which have been, and are likely to be more chargeable and burthensome to the Crown, for the Lands and Revenues, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his Majestie, have been intercepted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted by this Duke, and his friends; and strangely mis-imployed, with the confusion of the Accompts, and overthrow of the well established ancient Orders of his Majesties Exchequer.</p>
            <p>And the last of charges which are prepared, will be an injurie offered to the person of the late King of blessed memory, that is with God; of which as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships may have heard heretofore, you shall anon have farther informations.</p>
            <p>Now upon this occasion, I am to take care of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King our Soveraigne that lives, (long may he live to our comfort, and the good of the Christian world) and also of his blessed Father, to the grief of the Cōmons &amp; their great distast, the Lord Duke, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily (they conceive) did cast some ill odour of his own foule wayes, whereas ancient servants were wont to beare (as indeed they ought) their masters faults, and not cast their own on them: It is well known, the King that is with God, had the same power, and the same wisdome before he knew this Duke; yea, and the same affections too, through which, as a good and gracious master, he advanced some stars of your Lordships fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, in whose times the exorbitance of will, this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:196935:5"/>cendency of power, such placing and displacing of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, such irregular running into by-courses of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, such sole and singular managing of the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Kingdome was never heard of; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Lord Duke and this procurement by infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the faults complained of by the commons are to be imputed; And for our gracious Soveraigne that lives, whose name hath been used, and now perhaps may be for this Dukes justification: The commons know well that amongst His Majesties Royall Vertues, His Piety to His Father, hath made him a pious nourisher of His affections, even to this Lord Duke, on whom His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty out of that consideration, hath wrought a kinde of wonder, making favour Hereditary; But the abuse thereof must be the Dukes own; and if there have been any command, as were or may be pretended, his misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation hath procured them, whereas the Lawes of England teach us, that Kings cannot command ill, or unlawfull things, when ever they speak through their letters pattents, or their seals; If the thing be evill, these Letters Pattents are voyd, and whatsoever ill event succeeds, the executioners of such commands must ever answer for them.</p>
            <p>Thus my Lords in performance of my duty, my weaknesse hath been troublesome to your Lordships; It is now high time humbly to entreat your pardons, and to give way to a learned Gentleman to begin a more particular charge.</p>
